# Dental-Health-Assistant
This project is an intelligent Dental Health Assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It leverages a combination of natural language processing and a domain-specific knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user queries about dental health.
The system consists of:

main.py ‚Äì Handles backend logic for document retrieval, embedding, and generation, integrating with an LLM to produce relevant responses.

streamlit.py ‚Äì Provides an intuitive, interactive web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to ask dental health questions and receive informative responses in real time.

üîç Key Features
RAG-powered architecture for more factual and grounded answers

User-friendly web interface for seamless interaction

Designed for accessibility and educational purposes in dental health

üöÄ How to Run the Dental Health Assistant Locally
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shafimahadi/Dental-Health-Assistant.git
cd your-repo-name
3. Set up a Python environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
Make sure you have installed requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run Ollama in background.


5. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit.py
This will open the web app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

‚ö° Quick Summary
main.py = Backend logic (RAG system, retrieval, LLM)

streamlit.py = Frontend UI (user input, output display)
